<h1 align = "center"> Slimeicide </h1>


A small game about slimes. Check out current game play [here](https://lucasdahl.github.io/Slimeicide/)! The game is a simple game in which the player will collect items(currently slimes balls). The end game is a simple multiplayer game were the players will race. In the future I will try to expand the game.
